# KNN Iris Dataset

## Overview

This is an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the well-known Iris dataset. The goal is to predict the species of iris based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and contains 150 samples with 4 features each. There are 3 species of iris in the dataset: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The data can be loaded using the load_iris function from the scikit-learn library.

## Implementation

The KNN algorithm is implemented using the KNeighborsClassifier class from the scikit-learn library. The fit method is used to train the model on the data, and the predict method is used to make predictions on new data. The value of K (the number of nearest neighbors to consider) is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the model.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated by splitting the data into a training set and a test set, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the test set. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the accuracy_score function from the scikit-learn library.

## Usage

The implementation can be run by executing the included Python script. The script loads the data, splits it into training and test sets, trains the model, makes predictions on the test set, and calculates the accuracy of the model. The results are then displayed in a confusion matrix and a classification report.

## Conclusion

This is a basic implementation of the KNN algorithm on the Iris dataset. The algorithm can be further optimized by tuning the hyperparameters, using a different evaluation metric, or using a different machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the implementation can be extended to handle larger datasets or more complex data structures.
